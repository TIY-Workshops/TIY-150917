# Welcome!!!

Please use this time to get ready, if you need help ask 'Daryn'.

Can you please make sure you have Ruby installed. 

You can verify this in the console with:
```
$ ruby -v
ruby 2.0.0p645
```

Anything later that 1.9.0 is fine.

You will also need a text editor - sublime is a good choice

Thanks!
